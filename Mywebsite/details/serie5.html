        <p>The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring. I decided to give up less than half way through season 5. The flashbacks become uninteresting. The villains after 2 seasons are boring. Love story is soap opera material. Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic. Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks.</p>

        <p>I had been a big fan when Arrow came out. The first two seasons were really powerful. However, what came after that was forgetful and just basic. I cannot even remember what the hell happened after season 2.</p>
