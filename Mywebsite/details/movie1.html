        <p>Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.
           I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.
           It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the heros. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.
           The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.</p>

        <p>I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though).</p>
